# 🃏 Card Counting Assistant

This is a simple JavaScript project built as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. It simulates a basic card counting assistant to help players decide whether to "Bet" or "Hold" based on the cards dealt.

The goal of this lab is to practice working with:
- Global variables (`let`)
- Conditional logic
- `switch` statements
- String and number handling
- Return values based on dynamic state
